Hello! I am Brian, a 6th year PhD student at the Georgia Institute of Technology. While working with my PhD advisor Elisabetta Matsumoto, my research has revolved around investigating the oddities that arise when solving dynamics in spaces with instrinsic curvature. The presence of curvature results in geometric effects that challenge our everday intuition of how things move and interact. While these spaces are largely mathematical in nature, I feel that studying how systems evolution in such spaces can lead to a deeper insight of dynamics in flat space or at the very least allow one to think about dynamics from a different perspective in general.

Through computer simulations, my collaborator and I have been working on developing a physics engine designed to solve dynamics in arbitrary curved spaces. This is in pursuit of being able to better visualize and model deformable systems with internal controls in curved space. These systems can span from simple swimmers on the surface of a sphere or sword fighting octopuses in hyperbolic space. I am not only intereseted in the computational aspect of setting up and running the simulations, but also theoretically deriving the dynamical equations mathematical.

When I am not coding or deriving equations, I love hiking, watching horror/science fiction movies, and spending time with my amazing husband and our cats.
